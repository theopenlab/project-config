    description: |
      A subset of what the 'base' job provides: the absolute minimum considered
      required to run for any one job.
      It doesn't set up cached git repositories, will not set up mirrors,
      doesn't validate the node and does not generate an ARA report.
      These tasks, if required, can be included by the dependant jobs
      themselves on a need basis.

#      The base job for OpenStack's installation of Zuul.
#      
#      All jobs ultimately inherit from this.  It runs a pre-playbook
#      which copies all of the job's prepared git repos on to all of
#      the nodes in the nodeset.  It runs a post-playbook which copies
#      all of the files in the logs/ subdirectory of the executor
#      work directory to the logserver.
#      
#      It also sets default timeout and nodeset values (which may be
#      overidden).
